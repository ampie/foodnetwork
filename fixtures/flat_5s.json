So you would see Meat, Beef \r\n\t\t\tin the Category column for Hamburger per lb. \r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tTypically parent products would not be sold. In other words, \r\n\t\t\tyou would not sell plain Meat or Beef, but you would sell \r\n\t\t\tHamburger per lb.  The categories are useful to make the product \r\n\t\t\ttables more readable, and also they may be used for aggregate reports: \r\n\t\t\tfor example, how much Meat have we sold so far this year?\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<b>Customers</b>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n                <li>\r\n\t\t\t<b>Party Users</b>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tCustomers have their own section of the system for ordering.\r\n\t\t\tParty Users associate system users with the customer they work for. \r\n\t\t\tWhen a Party User logs into the system, they will automatically  \r\n\t\t\tbe redirected to the Customer section of the system, where they  \r\n\t\t\tcan see their own help page. \r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<b>Processors</b>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<b>Distributors</b>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<b>Process Types</b>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tThese specify different types of food processing, for example, \r\n                        meat slaughtering and cutting, or making frozen pizza.\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<b>Service Types</b>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tThese specify different types of services, for example, \r\n                        food processing services or transportation.\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Pre-season (or any time): enter plans for producers</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPlans are entered by producer, product and date range.  Plans ideally would be entered based on \r\n\tlast year's demand, maybe adjusted by a growth factor.  \r\n</p>\r\n</p>\r\n\tThe plans determine which producers and products appear in the Availability and Process forms for a given date.\r\n\tIf no plans, the producer will not appear in the selection list.  If no product plan, the product will\r\n\tnot appear in the form once you have selected a producer.  \r\n</p>\r\n\t\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou can use the Plan tab to enter plans for one date range per product for a producer (for example,\r\n\tfor the whole season).  If you want many date ranges per product for a producer, use Product Plans\r\n\tin Admin.\r\n</p>\r\n\t\r\n<h2>Weekly operation cycle</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><h3>Enter what's available this week</h3></li>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUse the Avail tab to enter what's available from producers, either on the farm \r\n        or somewhere else.  \r\n\tEach availability row shows two quantities:  Ready and Received.  \r\n\tReady means ready for pickup.  Received means received into warehouse inventory.  \r\n\tThe Custodian field refers to who has the goods other than the Producer.  \r\n\tCould be a Processor or a Distributor, \r\n\tand the goods might in the distributor's warehouse and so do not need to be picked up.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n       Use the Process tab to enter food that is being processed this week, and is now \r\n       ready to be ordered.  This food will usually be held at the Processor's.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe system keeps track of available quantities by deleting deliveries.\r\n</p>\r\n<p> \r\n        <b>Expiration:</b> Lots of available product expire (no longer are available) \r\n        after their expiration date.  The expiration date is set automatically when the lot \r\n        is created, by adding the product's expiration days to the lot's creation date. \r\n        The default expiration is 6 days.  In other words, lots will become unavailable \r\n        next week.\r\n        If you want all lots of a product to be available for longer, change the expiration days \r\n        for that product, and new lots will be available longer (but existing lots will not be changed). \r\n        If you want a particular lot or lots to be available longer, go into Admin and change the \r\n        expiration date on the lot (Inventory Item).\r\n</p>\r\n\t\r\n<li><h3>Send Fresh List emails to customers</h3></li>\r\n<p> This feature is temporarily disabled for redesign.</p>\r\n\t\r\n<li><h3>Enter orders</h3></li>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOrders may be entered by customers using their own section of the system,  \r\n\tor network staff may enter orders through the Order tab.\r\n        The form shows all available inventory items from all producers, and \r\n        you enter the quantities of each item that the current customer wants to order.  \r\n        You can also override unit prices, and enter notes about customer special requests.\r\n</p>\r\n\t\r\n<li><h3>Fill and ship orders</h3></li>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStaff prints out the Order Table for the delivery crew (from the Orders tab).  \r\n\tThe delivery crew marks it up to show which producer's food will go to which customers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStaff then enters the delivery info using the Update Lots tab.  \r\n        Sometimes filling one customer order item requires food from several producers.  \r\n        Update Lots accomodates this requirement.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<li><h3>Manage shorts</h3></li>\r\n\t\r\n<p>\r\n\tUse the Orders tab to view shorts, change short orders, \r\n        and short notice emails to customers..\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<li><h3>Send order emails to customers</h3></li>\r\n<p> This feature is temporarily disabled for redesign.</p>\r\n\t\r\n<li><h3>Print invoices</h3></li>\r\n\t\r\n<p>\r\n\tUse the Invoice tab to print invoices for each customer order.\r\n        The printed invoices may be delivered with the order.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<li><h3>Enter payments from customers</h3></li>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tPayments from customers can (eventually) enter the system three ways:\r\n</p>\r\n\t<ol>\r\n           <li>The customer pays invoices online with a credit card,</li>\r\n           <li>you enter customer payments and associate them with orders,</li>\r\n           <li>you just mark orders \"paid\".</li>  \r\n        </ol>\r\n<p>\r\n        Only the third method is implemented now.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou can mark orders \"paid\" through the Order tab, or Orders in Admin.\r\n</p>\r\n\t\r\n<li><h3>Compute payments to producers, processors and distributors</h3></li>\r\n\t\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Network pays producers etc. after the customer pays the order.  The Producer Payments tab \r\n        tells how much money is due to which producers, and Payment Update computes and enters the \r\n\tpayments that will be paid out this week.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n       <b>When payments are due:</b> If the Product or Service Type is marked \"pay on terms\", \r\n       then the member is paid on the Food Network's member terms.  If not, the member payment \r\n       is due when the customer pays for the order.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<li><h3>Print statements for producers, processors and distributors</h3></li>\r\n\t\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Statements tab generates printable statements to accompany payments. \r\n        Enter a date range, and statements will be generated for all payments within the range. \r\n        Note: the payments must be entered using Payment Update before the statements \r\n        will appear.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</ol>",
