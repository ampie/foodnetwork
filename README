foodnetwork is administrative software for food aggregation and distribution networks.

These are generally groups of farmers who aggregate food from many farmers and distribute it to many customers.

It is being refactored and generalized from two previous systems for two different food networks, one in Minnesota and one in Wisconsin.  The one in Wisconsin includes customers, distributors and processors as members as well as farmers.

You can read about the previous systems at http://www.group-accounting.com/Home/fooddistribution

This version of the software is not yet ready for use.  When ready, it will be used by 2 new food networks in the Driftless region of western Wisconsin.
